# Preflight Checks

At the start of each conversation, run the following checks in order.

---

## 1. Skill Version Check

Check whether a newer version of this skill is available. `currentSkillVersion` is the value of `metadata.version` in this skill's SKILL.md frontmatter.

### Syntax

```bash
baw skill-check --skill-name binance-agentic-wallet --current-version ${currentSkillVersion} --json
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "needUpdateSkill": true,
    "latestSkillVersion": "x.y.z"
  }
}
```

- **`needUpdateSkill` = true** → prompt the user: "A new version of the Binance Agentic Wallet skill is available (current: {currentSkillVersion}, latest: {latestSkillVersion}). Would you like to update now?" If the user confirms, install the latest version from https://github.com/binance/binance-skills-hub, then **re-read this file** before continuing to step 2 (the updated skill may require a different CLI version).
- **`needUpdateSkill` = false**, or the request fails → proceed silently.

---

## 2. CLI Version Check

Verify that the `baw` CLI meets the required version. The `requiredCliVersion` is the value of `metadata.requiredCliVersion` in this skill's SKILL.md frontmatter.

### Syntax

```bash
baw cli-check --required-version ${requiredCliVersion} --json
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "currentCliVersion": "x.y.z",
    "needUpdateCli": false
  }
}
```

- **`baw` not found** → install the required version.
- **`needUpdateCli` = true** → upgrade to the required version.
- **`needUpdateCli` = false** → no action needed.

### Install / Upgrade the CLI

The `baw` CLI is distributed as the npm package `@binance/agentic-wallet`. Use the following command to install or upgrade the required CLI version:

```bash
npm install -g @binance/agentic-wallet@${requiredCliVersion}
```

---

## 3. Wallet Connection Check

Before starting any wallet operation (or loading task-specific guidance), verify the wallet is connected.

### Syntax

```bash
baw wallet status --json
```

### Response

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "status": "CONNECTED" } }
```

- **`status` = `CONNECTED`** → proceed normally.
  - **Then check remaining session validity.** Run `baw wallet settings --json` and read `sessionExpireTime`. If it is within a few hours, tell the user up front — e.g. "Your wallet login expires around {time} (about {N}h from now); sessions last up to `maxSigninDuration` and also sign out after inactivity. If you'll be working past then, expect to re-sign-in." Sign-out is **silent** — the user otherwise only finds out when a later command fails. This is a general wallet courtesy, not campaign-specific; surface it once at the start, don't nag.
- **`status` = `UNCONNECTED`** (or not connected) → **stop here and get the user signed in first.** Do not keep reading large rule files, do not start explaining flows or strategy, and do not attempt any command that needs a wallet — the user will otherwise only discover the failure later when a call errors out, and assume the feature is broken.
  - If the user has **never created an Agentic Wallet** → direct them to create one in the Binance App / the relevant product page.
  - If they **have an AW but are not signed in on this device** → guide them through `baw auth signin` → `auth verify` (scan the QR in the Binance App).
